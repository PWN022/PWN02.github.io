# 选词填空技巧

**当句子出现介词/连词时，可直接忽略。**

# 动词

## 不定式后的动词原形

- **不定式的标志词to后面要跟动词原形**

大多数的to都是不定式的标志词，后面直接跟v.

Parents / **want** / **to** ___ a friendly relationship with their teenagers.

遇到难拆的句子，可以先填动词原形，如果感觉句意不通可以当介词填doing形式。（do/doing）

My task / is / to build fluency / while providing / the oppositertunity / interent in any writing activity / to ___ the normal and emotional development of my students.(目的状语)

And other studies have found that watching ads for beer and popcorn may make you more **likely to** ___ them.(likely to do)

## 情态动词后的动词原形

情态动词：can could,may might,must have to,dare need,shall should,will would,ought to;

But I'll accept anxiety as another name for challenge and I believe  I **can** ___ wonders.

This **may** ___ strange to you, since nearly 70% of the earth's surface is covered with water.

I had been abroad a couple of times, but I **could hardly** ___ to know my way around the continent.

And simple flexibility training **can** ___ **these** by making muscles stronger and keeping joints lubricated.

Who wants to be ... what you **can** ___ based on ...(based 形容词/被动的过去分词)

## 一般现在时中的动词原形

**一般现在时要考虑是动词原形还是三单**

**Respect** your roommate's possessions and privacy **and** ___ your roommate to do the same for you.  
and并列关系,your roommate 对应 your roommate's,填空处对应respect.

Many American parents **do not know** how to deal with thier teenagers and ___ advice from books...  
do not know 作谓语,所以填空处同样也作谓语.

Parents and children **often** ___ about ...(often出现不是动词原形就是三单)

and nearly all **grow up** into "solid citizens" who / ___ most of their parents' expectations.(who连词/引导定从)  
who指代的是"solid citizens"复数,所以填空处为动词原形.

If you **discover** that **(your schedule and your roommate's schedule)** ___ and you **have** little time to study,

## 填动词的第三人称单数作谓语

and four other woman / whose research(抽象名词)/ ___ / everything / from the mechanics of the universe to the samllest particles of matter.  
抽象名词默认为单数所以填第三人称单数.

He immediately ___ the solution to his problem : he must clean the gear wheels.

sometimes / the final **idea**/ ___ very suddenly / because the thinker suddenly **sees** something...

**science**(抽象名词) / ___ / that genes **lay(原形,推出是一般现在时)** the groundwork for mant human traits.

The simple **story** about Newton ___ what makes a great mind.(make 客观事实,所以是一般现在时,单三用makes)  
核心为story,单数,所以填第三人称单数.

## 一般过去时中填过去式作谓语

**（只有一般现在时分原形和三单）**

Researchers/ ___ 92 families/ from 11 child care centers/ before their children were a year old,  
看到were直接写v+ed.

Finally, the researchers / ___ /the children's speechch at age 3,(接上题,直接写过去式)

the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes(糖尿病) **rose** 20% over 8.5 years,the risk of heart disease **increased** 15% over a decade, and the odds(可能性) of dying prematurely(过早死亡) ___ 13% during a seven-year follow-up.  
前两个百分比之前的单词都为过去式

**were** possible because / the United States then / ___ the world in mathematics and science education.  
because 连词,the U S then 原因状从作主语,填空处为谓语,只要是谓语就要找时态.

we have experienced a 20,000-year-long warming as the last ice age **ended** and the ice ___ away,  
and连接两个时间状语从句

## 填过去分词跟助动词一起构成谓语

has/have + 过去分词,现在完成时	has been done

had + 过去分词,过去完成时

In short, he has ___ the problem.

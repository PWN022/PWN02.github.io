# 选词填空技巧

**当句子出现介词/连词时，可直接忽略。**

# 动词

## 填doing系列(动名词或现在分词)
<br>
- **现在分词短语做作状语**
<br>
题型:**开头（填空处）**__ ，___.

<br>**Walking** in the street,I saw him.(时间)  

只能判断出是分词，根据句意判断现在/过去分词

**Working** hard,you'll succeed.（条件）

His friend died,**getting**  him  a lot of money.（结果）

- **介词后的动名词**

介词后其实只跟名词，一个动词要跟在介词后面，只能被迫变成名词。

区分介词后填名词/动名词，填动名词的时候，横线后通常还有宾语。(主/宾语现在分词都做不了)

介宾结构

<br>题型:介词  +<u>**动名词短语**</u>  +名词短语

<br>There are six stages/ in /**___**(doing) a problem.

Their reason / for thinking or ___(doing)/ one way or another is that the crowd is doing it.(并列）

(in addition后面的to必为介词,pay attention to同样也是)

<br>

- **(动词)   +形容词   +名词，横线后必是名词。**

Books **provide**___**benefit** from walking.

Encouraing them to **consider**___choices that few young people give any thought to.

<br>
